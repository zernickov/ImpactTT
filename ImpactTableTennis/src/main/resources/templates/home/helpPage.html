<div class="disclaimer" style="color: red">
<p>Disclaimer: This website is only for internal use, meaning that we players should be able to trust each other</p>
<p>This includes: Never declare yourself the Winner of a match that you did not win! same goes for losing</p>
<p>Note that it is not recommended to find a new match, before you have declared whether you lost or won your last match</p>
<p>FYI: The admin has the right to subtract your ELO points as well as delete your profile.. so behave!</p>
</div>
    <h1>How To Find A Match?</h1>
<p>To start af match you need to click the "Find Match" button located in the column called "Quick Match" right under your profile information</p>
<p>The "Find Match" button looks like this:</p>

<button>Find Match</button>

<p>After this your profile will be transfered to the second column: "Next Match", where you will stay until the system has found an opponent for you</p>
<p>Note that if the opponent was found before or at the same time that you searched for a match you will be directly transfered to the "Upcoming Matches" overview</p>
<p>"Upcoming Matches" represents the queue of unfinished matched</p>
<p>After you have finished your match you need to declare whether you've lost or won the match</p>
<p>This is done by pressing the appropriate button, the two buttons look like this:</p>

<button>I WON</button>
<button>I LOST</button>

<p>The match has now been stored in the system and your ELO has been updated</p>
<p>ELO DESCRIPTION: The ELO-rating system is a method of calculating the relative skill levels of players in zero-sum games, meaning the higher the ELO the better the player</p>
<p>Now that you know the rules... Go own that leaderboard!</p>
